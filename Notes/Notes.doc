Node-API --> (formerly N-API) is an API for building native Addons. 
             It is independent from the underlying JavaScript runtime (for example, V8) 
             and is maintained as part of Node.js itself.

Hoisting --> Calling a function before declaring it

Type Coercion -->Automatic conversion of values from one data type to another 
                 during certain operations

Ternary Operator --> Let result = condition ? 'Yes' : 'No' --> syntax

Arrays --> Keeps data Structured

While VS For

argument --> actual values
parameter --> Place holder --> then argument  is passed

EVENTS 

eg - Clicking a button
user interact with a page
        |
        |
    event occurs
        |
        |
A peice of JS code runs in response
        |
        |
Page appearance is updated

event handler --> it is a callback function


DOM --> It is a platform and language neutra interface that allows
        programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, 
        structure and style of the document


API --> different system or application to communicate with each other

Application --> Any software that has a specific purpose
Interface --> Contract or protocol  between 2 application
req and res cycle is API call

string immutable

Control flow --> Control flow in Node.js refers to the sequence in which
                  statements and functions are executed. 

Crypto module --> is used for encrypting, decrypting, or hashing any type of data.

Passport module -->  is used for adding authentication features to our website or web app.

Process.nextTick() --> method is used to add a new callback function at the start 
                       of the next event queue. 

function --> reusable peice of code, performs a specific task when called

idempotence --> performing same operation multiple ti es and getting same output

Stream --> A sequence of data thatis being moved from one point to another over time
